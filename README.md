Flight Fare Prediction ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️

Predicting flight fares is a critical problem in the aviation industry and can help customers plan their journeys efficiently. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict flight fares based on features like date of journey, source, destination, airline, and more.

🚀 Project Overview
---

The Flight Fare Prediction project leverages historical flight data and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that estimates flight prices. The goal is to help users identify the most cost-effective flight options and plan their travel efficiently.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, encode categorical features, and engineer time-based features.
Machine Learning Models:
Decision Tree for basic prediction.
Advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for better accuracy.
Web Application: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask to allow users to input travel details and get fare predictions.
Deployment: Deployed on Heroku with high uptime and reliability.

The dataset contains information on:

Airline: The airline operating the flight.
Date of Journey: The date the flight departs.
Source and Destination: Departure and arrival cities.
Duration: Total travel time.
Number of Stops: Number of stops during the flight.
Price: The fare of the flight (target variable).
